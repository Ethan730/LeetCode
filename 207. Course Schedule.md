# 题目：

There are a total of *n* courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `n-1`.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: `[0,1]`

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite **pairs**, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 2, [[1,0]] 
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
             also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
```

**Note:**

1. The input prerequisites is a graph represented by **a list of edges**, not adjacency matrices. Read more about [how a graph is represented](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/graph-representation/a/representing-graphs).
2. You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.

# 理解：

就是给一个AOV网，判断是否存在关键路径。或者说，是否存在某种选课顺序，使得可以正常选完所有的课程。

# 思路：

使用BFS的思想，寻找入度为0的定点，然后把对应的边从图中删除（影响相应的入度）。

# 实现：

1. C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
	bool canFinish(int numCourses, vector<pair<int, int>>& prerequisites) {
		// construct the graph
		vector<unordered_set<int>> graph(numCourses);
		for (auto pre : prerequisites) {
			graph[pre.second].insert(pre.first);
		}

		//calculate the in-degree
		vector<int> degree(numCourses, 0);
		for (auto &s : graph) {
			for (auto i : s) {
				degree[i]++;
			}
		}
		for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
			int j;
			for (j = 0; j < numCourses; j++)
				if (!degree[j])
					break;
			if (j == numCourses) return false;
			degree[j] = -1;
			for (auto i : graph[j])
				degree[i]--;
		}
		return true;
	}
};
```
